# Payment options
<p class="intro">Here at Energy Online we offer a range of payment options for you to pay your account.  If you don't already do so, remember that you can reduce your bill by taking advantage of our Prompt Payment Discount; all you have to do is pay in full and on time each month.  There are several options for you to choose from.</p>

## [Direct Debit](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/home/payment_options/direct_debit)
With Direct Debit, your bill is paid automatically from your bank account on the due date. As long as thereare sufficient funds in your bank account to cover your bill, you'll always receive your Prompt Payment Discount.

You always have up to two days to call us if you want to discuss anything or stop a payment before funds are deducted from your account. Best of all, we pay any direct debit set-up fees! [More about Direct Debit](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/home/payment_options/direct_debit)
