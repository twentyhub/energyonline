## Billing to actual reads
 
**9 June 2009**

At Energy Online we value the feedback we receive from our customers. You’ve said you don’t want estimated invoices so we’re going to bill you up to the date of your actual meter reads.  If your meter can be accessed by our meter readers, this means no more estimation!

We are sending letters over the next few weeks informing you of the transition to billing to actual reads. You will receive information in that letter as to when your meter is likely to be read and about the transition invoice moving you from your current billing cycle to your new billing cycle based on actual meter readings received.

We're pleased to offer this service to you.  If there is anything you would like to discuss about this - please contact our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66).
