**13 November 2009**

We are changing our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=169) to facilitate a Gas offering in some of our supply areas, and to reflect the Electricity Commission’s guidelines for residential contract terms.

Our new Terms and Conditions also include some useful information not covered in our old Terms and Conditions, such as: 

- Information for our vulnerable customers, including what you should do if unable to pay an invoice; and
- Information on our smoothed payment product, ReliaBill®; and
- Clear definitions of terms used; and
- What you should do if you dispute an invoice, or have a complaint about our service.
