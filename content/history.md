# Energy Online - A History
<p class="intro">Following the introduction of the electricity reforms which resulted in the separation of lines and energy businesses, Energy Online Limited was established as an independent retailer in 2000. In December 2002, Genesis Power Limited bought Energy Online from (then) publicly listed Newcall Group Limited.</p>


From our small beginnings we have grown organically to 70,000 customers, with our primary focus on retailing energy services to our expanding customer base in the North Island of New Zealand.

In March 2012, Energy Online was amalgamated with Genesis Energy Limited) and Energy Online is now operating as a separate retail brand under Genesis Energy Limited.

Energy Online is a growing energy retailer, and while we may not be as big as the competition, we aim to deliver quality service to our customers. We are continuously working to improve service to our customers through new offerings.
