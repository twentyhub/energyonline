**1 October 2010**

The Government has increased the rate of tax on goods and services (GST) from 12.5% to 15%, which came into effect on 1st October 2010. Your Energy Online invoice issued on or after 1st October 2010 includes the new rate of 15% GST.

Applicable tax law means that supply is considered to take place at the time our invoice is issued, not when the energy was consumed. This means that for supply of energy prior to 1st October, where your invoice has been issued on or after 1st October 2010, your invoice for that supply will be subject to GST at the rate of 15%.
