After months of legal battles, electricity consumers will receive a rebate on their electricity bills.

But only if they apply for it.

Horizon Energy chief executive Dene Biddlecombe is urging all consumers to take part in the settlement the wholesaler has won for them.

By the end of June, Horizon Energy is planning to pay out cash to every electricity consumer who has a connection with the Whakatane-based lines network company.

He said the refund would total nearly $1 million and would be simple for some consumers who would automatically receive the refund in their power account. But most of the Eastern Bay consumers will have to apply either via website or "snail mail''.

"All customers of Bay of Plenty Electricity connected to the Horizon Energy Network need to register manually for the refund. The refund will be paid to any customers connected as at last weekend."

When apportioned, the distribution will entitle approximately 23,860 residential consumers to each receive a refund of $35.

The refund is because Horizon Energy was successful last year in obtaining a substantial settlement in a legal dispute with a supplier regarding the level of fees charged.

Mr Biddlecombe said the rebate would be automatic for local customers of Energy Online, Genesis Energy, Contact-Energy, Mighty River Power and TrustPower.

"The co-operation of these energy retailers is very much appreciated and means these customers will simply receive a credit on their power account.

"It will be noted [on the account] as Horizon Energy Refund.

"However, more than 95 per cent of Eastern Bay of Plenty households buy their electricity from Bay of Plenty Electricity and these consumers will need to apply for the refund directly with Horizon Energy."

Customers can register on-line by completing and submitting the Horizon Energy Refund Application available at www.horizonenergy.net.nz/refund. Alternatively, Bay of Plenty Electricity customers can post either a copy or the original of their April power account from Bay of Plenty Electricity to Horizon Energy at PO Box 281, Whakatane.

Mr Biddlecombe said customers who lived along the East Coast and in other rural areas could leave their April invoice from Bay of Plenty Electricity in a drop box at one of the following: Omaio Store, Te Kaha Hotel, Te Kaha Holiday Park and Cafe, Waihau Bay Store or Murupara Four Square.

Bay of Plenty Electricity power account holders need to register for the refund by June 15, which is the final cut-off day to enable processing and mailing of the refund cheque to the Bay of Plenty electricity account holder by June 30.
