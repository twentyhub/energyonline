**28 February 2007**

Bay of Plenty Electricity is appearing before the High Court in Wellington to defend charges of anti-competitive behaviour in breach of the Commerce Act.

The Commerce Commission alleges that the Whakatane-based power company, a private company owned by Todd Energy, restricted trade by denying other electricity companies access to its meters.

The case started two weeks ago and is scheduled for a further two weeks.

Yesterday, Todd Energy managing director Richard Tweedie said there were no barriers to competition in the Eastern Bay and the situation had changed since the issues before the court were first raised when there was chaos in the electricity market.

He said the case was complex and a raft of economists were being called to appear in court, including one from the United States representing the Commerce Commission.

The commission has taken more than four years to bring the matter to court. The case stems from efforts by other electricity suppliers, including Energy Online and TrustPower, to gain access to meters which were owned by BOPE.

A supplier having ownership of meters is unusual in New Zealand; the meters tend to be owned by companies that own the power lines.

Mr Tweedie said BOPE had no problem selling its meters to others or in allowing other suppliers to install their own meters.

In 2000, Energy Online mounted a campaign to gain customers in the Eastern Bay. But in October 2002 it said it had cancelled 58 contracts signed by Whakatane electricity customers who wanted to switch from BOPE because the switching process had been made too difficult.

Denying this at the time, BOPE said customers wanting to switch could buy and have their own meters installed provided they complied with the industry standard.

Another electricity retailer, TrustPower, told the Beacon in October 2002 that it was unable to supply power to Eastern Bay domestic consumers because it did not have an arrangement with BOPE for access to meters.

Then TrustPower community relations manager Graeme Purches said TrustPower was receiving on average a dozen calls a day from Eastern Bay consumers wanting to switch.

At the 2002 annual meeting of the Whakatane Citizensâ€™ Advice Bureau, a complaint was raised about consumers being unable to switch suppliers. The complaint was taken up by the then Whakatane mayor Colin Hammond who, in turn, complained to Energy Minister Pete Hodgson.

He said action had been filed in the High Court in Wellington and it was the first time action had been taken against a power company.

Mr Hodgson said if the court found that BOPE had breached the Commerce Act it could impose penalties of up to $10 million.

He said that Meridian Energy had attempted entry into the Eastern Bay market and other retailers had been interested. Power companies were not allowed to introduce undue barriers to competition.
