On Monday 3rd May, Energy Online worked closely with Jade Promotions and 94.2 More FM in the Hawkes Bay to sponsor a radio promotion called ‘Live Green for a Week’. The five qualifying Hawkes Bay families were challenged to compete by living as ‘green’ as possible for seven days, the winner being the family to have used the least amount of power at the end of the week.

Headed by young Annaliese age 16, the entire Paton family has benefitted by receiving a $1,000 credit on their existing Energy Online account. With the impact of the competition being felt by the entire family, Annaliese said “we didn’t use any lights” and “we washed our dishes with water boiled on the stove and didn’t use the dish-washer”. The family clearly showed their commitment to the cause by even turning down their water heater, making short showers a necessity.
