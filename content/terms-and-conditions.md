1 INTRODUCTION
These are the terms of **your** relationship with **Energy Online**.

In remaining, or becoming, an **Energy Online** customer, **you** and **Energy Online** agree to these terms and conditions, unless agreed otherwise in writing.

These terms and conditions are a legally binding document between us. 

These terms and conditions are effective from 16 January 2014. However, if **you** are an existing **Energy Online** customer on 16 January 2014, these terms and conditions will apply to **you** from 16 February 2014. These terms and conditions replace any previous agreement(s) **we** have with **you**.

These terms and conditions apply to both electricity and reticulated gas supplied to **you** by **us**.

Where **we** have used words in bold in these terms and conditions, they have a special meaning and are defined at the end of these terms and conditions.

If **you** wish to contact **us**, please:

• write to **us** at:
Energy Online
Private Bag 3131
Waikato Mail Centre
Hamilton 3240

• or fax **us** on 09 539 4633
• or email **us** at customer.care@energyonline.co.nz
• or call our Customer Care Team on 0800 086 400.

**We** will try to respond to any written enquiries as soon as reasonably possible. Depending on levels of customer enquiries at the time **we** receive **your** enquiry, **we** expect to respond to **your** enquiry within two business days.

2 HOW DO YOU BECOME AN ENERGY ONLINE CUSTOMER?
2.1 To apply to become a customer** you **can:

• complete a Customer Application Form, available from our website; or
• email **us** at the email address set out above; or
• call **us** on the relevant number set out above; or
• fax **us** on the number set out above.

**We** will respond to **your** application within 2 business days from receipt of **your** application if **we** require further information from **you** or **your** application to join has been declined. 

2.2 An agreement between **you** and **us** is formed on these terms and conditions when in our sole discretion **we** accept **your** application to join **us** and the agreement will apply from the date on which **you** first use **energy** supplied by **us**, and **you** will be liable to pay our charges from that date.  **We** may require **you** to provide evidence of when **you** first use **energy** supplied by **us** through a certificate of title or tenancy agreement.  Where **you** apply to join **us** before using **energy** supplied by **us**, the supply of **energy** to **you** will commence as soon as possible following our acceptance of **your** application.

If **you** have moved to **premises** and started using **energy**, **you** will still need to call **us** to become a customer. If **you** do not contact **us** to become a customer, **we** will disconnect the property. **We** may also charge **you** a disconnection fee, the cost of any **energy** consumed, and any other costs **we** incur as a result of **you** consuming **energy** at the **premises** as specified in our price list.

2.3 What information do we need from you? 

To become a customer **you** will need to provide **us** with some personal information. **We** may use this information for a number of purposes, as set out in our Privacy Policy. **You** can view our Privacy Policy here.

**We** may also request information (including credit information) from relevant third parties such as credit reference agencies and other **energy** retailers prior to **you** becoming an **Energy Online** customer and at any point while **you** are an **Energy Online** customer, as part of our credit criteria.

If any of **your** personal information changes (including **your** contact details) please tell **us**, and **we** will update **your** account information.

2.4 What do we do with your personal information? 

Any personal information **you **give **us** is strictly confidential and will be kept secure and held by **us** in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993. **You** can view our privacy policy here. That policy outlines how **we** deal with **your** personal information. **You** can access **your** personal information held by **us** on request and correct it if it is wrong. 

2.5 Can more than one person be a customer?

If more than one person is the customer at any **premises**, these terms will apply to each of **you **jointly and severally. This means that each of **you** may individually be responsible for paying our entire invoice, and that everyone who wishes to become a customer will have to contact **us**. 

**You** may nominate a person as an account authority to make decisions for **you** under these terms. However, **you** are still responsible as a customer for payment of **your** account and for any costs associated with decisions made by the account authority. 

2.6 What if you have unpaid invoices?

As a customer **you** will be responsible for paying all fees and charges and for making sure the requirements of this agreement are met.  **We** will give **you** reasonable notice if circumstances arise, or are likely to arise, which will mean that **you** will incur a fee in addition to **your** standard rates for **energy** supplied by **us**, including for unpaid invoices.  

**You** agree that **we** may add any of **your** unpaid invoices with **us** from other **premises** to **your** next invoice for **energy** used at **your** new **premises**. The amount owing must be paid in accordance with the terms of **your** previous account, unless **we** agree otherwise, but a default in payment of **your** previous account may be treated by **us** as a default under this agreement. 

Please note that if **you**, or another person at **your** **premises**, have any unpaid invoices with **us**, **we** may refuse to supply **energy** to **your** **premises** or accept **you** as a customer until that invoice has been paid.

3 IS A BOND REQUIRED?
3.1 **We** may ask **you** for a cash bond and/or a satisfactory credit check before **you** become our customer and **we** supply **energy** or other services. If this is the case, **we** will tell **you** when **you** become our customer and **we** will give **you** reasons for our decision.  This decision will comply with any relevant regulations or industry standards. If **we** require a bond, it will be invoiced as early as possible after **we** accept **you** as a customer. **You** must pay the bond within the timeframe specified on the invoice.

**We** may also ask **you** for a bond at any time if **you** are unable to establish a satisfactory credit record or maintain a satisfactory payment record with **us**.

Any bond for electricity-only residential customers or for gas-only residential customers will not exceed $150. If **we** supply **you** with both electricity and gas for **your** residential **premises**, **your** bond will not exceed $200. If **you** are a commercial customer **your** bond will be as agreed with **you**, or as per our schedule of fees.  **We** will not pay interest on the bond. The bond will be held in trust on **your** behalf in a separate account. 

3.2 **We** will repay **your** bond, less any amounts **you** owe **us**, within one month of:

• **you** maintaining a satisfactory payment record for at least 12 months; or
• terminating our supply of **energy** to **you**, whichever is earlier.

**We** will do this by:

• crediting **your** account with **us**;
• sending **you** a cheque; or
• paying **you** by direct credit to **your** nominated bank account. 

If **we** keep **your** bond for longer than one year, **we** will explain why.

4 WHAT IF YOU’RE MOVING HOUSE?
4.1 If **you** move house **you** must:

• give **us** at least three business days’ notice of **your** move and **your** new address so **we** can send **you** a final invoice.  This requirement for **you** to provide **us** with three business days' notice of **your** move is consistent with applicable regulations and industry standards as at the date of these terms; and 
• let **us** complete a final **meter** reading at **your** old **premises** (a charge applies) or let **us** take a final **meter** reading remotely if an **advanced meter** has been installed at **your** old **premises** (a charge may apply) or, at our discretion, provide **us** with a final reading over the phone or via our website.

If the final **meter** reading provided by **you** does not match **your** rate of consumption **we** may ask for a final **meter** reading to be carried out by an approved **meter** reader, or take a final **meter** reading remotely if an **advanced meter** has been installed, and **we** may adjust **your** final invoice accordingly. If this is the case we will endeavour to contact **you** at the phone number **you** have provided **us**.  **We** will only take a reading from the **meter** at **your** **premises** in circumstances that are consistent with applicable regulations and industry standards.  

If **we** agree to supply **energy** to **your** new **premises**, these terms and conditions will apply to **your** new **premises**.

4.2 What if you’re moving out but others are staying?

If **you** leave **your** **premises** (e.g. if **you** move from a flat but **your** flatmates are staying on) and **your** name is on the **energy** account, it’s important to tell **us** that **you** are terminating your account with **us**, and if necessary make arrangements to transfer it to someone else. If **you** wish to transfer **your** account to someone else at the **premises**, **we** will need to speak to that person(s) and accept them as our customer before the account can be transferred. If **you** remain the account holder and **energy** is consumed at the **premises** after **you** leave, **you** will remain liable to **us**. 

4.3 What if you have a new connection, an altered connection or a reconnection?

For safety reasons, if **you** have a new or altered gas or electricity connection, or if **your** supply has been disconnected, **we** may require **you** to provide a certificate of compliance or certificate of verification from a certified service provider before **we** can supply **you** with **energy**. **We** may also request a copy of this certificate at any time.

5 WILL THE SUPPLY OF ENERGY BE CONTINUOUS?
5.1 Circumstances or events beyond our control (including the events specified in section 17.2 below) may cause supply to be interrupted from time to time. For example, the **network company** may shut down all or part of its **network** or the **meter company** may interrupt supply for maintenance or improving the reliability of supply.  The **network** may also be affected by a storm, high winds, third party interference like a car accident or for other reasons. **We** cannot give warning or notice of sudden, unplanned shutdowns or outages. **We** are not required to honour this agreement where circumstances or events that are beyond our control prevent **us** from doing the things **we** would normally do.  In these circumstances, **we** will carry on honouring our obligations as soon as it is reasonably practicable for **us** to do so.

5.2 **Energy Online** or the applicable **network company** or **meter company** will give **you** at least 4 working days’ notice of any planned shutdowns, unless the shutdown is urgently required for reasons that were not reasonably foreseeable such that 4 working days' notice is not possible.  In the event of any urgent shutdown of this nature, **we** will give **you** as much notice of the shutdown as possible.  

**You** can call **us** at any time for information about any planned interruption. 

5.3 The time that it will take to reconnect **your** supply of **energy** following any shutdown will depend on the **network company** that is responsible for the supply of **energy** to **your** **premises**, as that **network company** will be the person which reconnects **your** supply. 

5.4 **You** can access a list of telephone numbers to contact **us** if **you** need to report a supply interruption, or access information about a supply interruption, by clicking here.  Alternatively, **you** can contact **us** at any time on 0800 083 285 and **we** will direct **you** to someone who can help.  Information about a supply interruption will be updated regularly in accordance with good industry practice in New Zealand. 

If **you** have sensitive equipment or property which may be affected by an interrupted supply, **we** strongly recommend that **you** protect that equipment or property in case of an unplanned shutdown or outage. See also section 22 below on sensitive equipment. 

5.5 If **you** have a controlled load pricing option i.e. a price plan that allows** Energy Online** to either directly, or via a third party, remotely control the supply of **energy** to some or all equipment in **your** **premises**, some of **your** electrical appliances (e.g. hot water cylinders and night store heaters) will be switched off or adjusted as agreed from time to time. Controlled load periods will be limited to those set out in our price list and **we** will respond to controlled load system faults in accordance with our normal practices, after you have advised **us** of the problem. 

In the event of a local or national **energy** shortage, or in circumstances of extreme wholesale prices, **your** **energy** supply may be rationed or restricted. **Energy** may also be rationed as part of an **energy** industry rationing plan.

6 METERS AND METER READINGS
6.1 **We** will read the **meter(s**) at **your** **premises** on a regular basis and, as long as **we** have access, **we** plan to read the **meter(s)** at least once every two months, unless **we** both agree otherwise. In addition to these regular **meter** readings, **we** may also read the meter(s) at **your** **premises** for any special or final **meter** reading.  The provisions of this agreement relating to **metering** and the circumstances in which **we** will take a reading from the **meter** at **your** **premises** will be in accordance with applicable regulations and industry standards.  

 **You** can provide **us** with additional **meter** readings here or by calling **us**. 

**We** can decide whether or not to accept **your** readings. If **we** do not accept **your** readings, **we** may carry out a special **meter** reading within 5 days. If it turns out **your** reading was accurate, **we** will not charge **you** for the cost of our special **meter** reading. If **your** reading was inaccurate, **we** may charge **you** for the cost of our special **meter** reading.

6.2 What if you are a new customer? 

If **you** are a new customer, **we** will use the previous final **meter** reading at the **premises** as **your** initial **meter** reading, unless **you** read the **meter** before using any **energy** and advise **us** of that **meter** reading within one business day of **you** moving in. If **your** **meter** reading differs from the previous final **meter** reading at the **premises**, **we** may arrange for the **meter** to be read and **we** will use that reading as **your** initial **meter** reading.

Alternatively, if an advanced **meter** has been installed at **your** **premises**, **we** may, in our discretion, take an initial **meter** reading remotely and any such reading will be conclusive evidence of the initial **meter** reading from the date **you** become our customer. 

6.3 What if the meter is faulty?

**We** may arrange to have the **meter** at **your** **premises** tested if **we** think it is faulty or if **you** tell **us** that **you** think it is faulty or not reflective of **your** actual consumption.

**We** will remove the **meter** for testing within 5 business days if **you** ask **us** to.

If **we** test a **meter**, **we** will inform **you** of the results of the test on request and if: 

• it is clear that there is an inherent fault with the **meter** itself, **we** will replace or repair the **meter** at our, or the **metering company's**, cost; or 
• otherwise, **we** may charge **you** our costs for testing, replacing and/or repairing the **meter**. 

**We** will inform **you** of any extra charge **you** might incur if **we** do test **your** **meter** prior to undertaking this work.  **We** will also inform **you** prior to taking any action on **your** **meter** which may impact on **your** invoices or result in an extra charge. The process set out above for remedying faulty meters complies with relevant regulations and industry standards as at the date of these terms.

Our obligation to inform **you** under this section 6.3 does not apply where: 

• there is a safety issue; or
• **you** have materially breached these terms and conditions. 

**You** must notify **us** immediately if **you** become aware that the **meter** or related equipment is tampered with, damaged, defective or looks unsafe.

6.4 What do we do with meter reading information?

**You** agree that **we** own all **meter reading** information. 

To the extent that any **meter reading** information constitutes "personal information" for the purposes of the Privacy Act 1993, **we** will ensure that that **meter reading** information is held by **us** in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993 and our privacy policy. **You** consent to **us**:

• receiving and collecting **meter reading** information in respect of **you** and **your** **premises**;
• storing **meter reading** information in respect of **you** and **your** **premises** in a way that is referenced back to **you** individually and/or **your** **premises**;
• using **meter reading** information in respect of **you** and **your** **premises** for any other purpose, including, without limitation, for the purposes outlined in section 2.4 and to invoice **you** accurately for **your** **energy** usage; and 
• disclosing **meter reading** information in respect of **you** and **your** **premises** to third parties. 

**You** may not sell, assign or provide any **meter reading** information to any third party without our prior written consent, except for the purpose of comparing prices with other **energy** retailers. 

6.5 Advanced meters

**We** may, at any time, replace the **meter** at **your** **premises** with an **advanced meter**. **You** agree that **you** will not object to **us**, or prevent **us** from, replacing **your** **meter** with an **advanced meter**. 

6.6 What if an advanced meter cannot be installed at your premises?

If an **advanced meter** cannot be installed at **your** **premises** because the wiring at **your** **premises** does not comply with any applicable laws, regulations, codes or standards, or because the **advanced meter** would, when installed, represent a safety hazard or where there is insufficient space on the **meter** board, **we** may require **you** to fix, remedy or repair the wiring or safety hazard, or install a larger **meter** board or otherwise address the lack of space on **your** **meter** board at **your** cost before an **advanced meter** is installed at **your** **premises**.

**We** may also require **you** to provide a certificate of compliance from a certified service provider at **your** cost before the **advanced meter** is installed. **We** may also request a copy of this certificate at any time.

6.7 Will there be manual meter readings with advanced meters?

If an **advanced meter** has been installed at **your** **premises**, **we** may still need to read **your** **meter** manually in some situations (e.g. if the **advanced meter** is faulty, the mains switch is turned off or if there have been failures in the **metering communications network**). If the manual reading is required because **you** have caused a communications fault, **we** may pass on the cost of the manual reading to **you**.

6.8 What if I miss an appointment?

If **we** or a **meter company** make an appointment with **you** to install, connect, test, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, alter, service, clean, disconnect or remove any **metering** equipment or other equipment, and **you** miss the agreed appointment, **we** may pass on to **you** any reasonable charges **we** incur as a result of **you** missing the appointment.

7 WHAT ACCESS DO YOU NEED TO PROVIDE?
7.1 **You** must:

• provide to **us**, the **meter company**, the **network company** and/or other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises**, safe and unobstructed access to **metering equipment**, and any equipment of the **network company** or any other person on **your** **premises** between 8.00am and 7.00pm, Monday to Sunday, excluding public holidays;
• provide to **us**, the **meter company**, the **network company** and/or other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises**, immediate access to **your** **premises** at any time for safety reasons or to prevent serious damage to property or the environment;
• allow to **us**, the **meter company**, the **network company** and/or other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises**, access for installation, connection, testing, inspection, maintenance, repair, replacement, alteration, servicing, cleaning, disconnection or removal of any equipment owned by **us** and/or a **meter company** and/or a **network company** and/or other third parties including removal of any equipment up to 6 months after termination of supply to **you**;
• ensure that any dog or other animal that may make entry unsafe is secured to enable safe and easy access;
• keep **us** informed about any health and safety and/or Resource Management Act 1991 requirements or issues at **your** **premises** that could be relevant to our representatives or the representatives of a **meter company** or a **network company** or other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises** when they visit your **premises**; 
• keep **your** trees and other vegetation regularly trimmed to a safe distance from any lines, pipes, substations, **meters** or equipment, to comply with the Electricity (Safety) Regulations 2010 in relation to any work near lines, the **network** or other electrical equipment, and the Electricity (Hazards from Trees) Regulations 2003. The Electricity (Hazards from Trees) Regulations 2003 specify the distances trees and other vegetation must be kept from power lines. If vegetation grows within these minimum distances (or Zones) cutting or trimming will be necessary.  **You** can view a summary of these regulations here. If **you** do not comply with these regulations (including any amendments to these regulations), **you** will be liable for the costs of carrying out any work arising as a result of **your** non-compliance.

7.2 **You** must, if requested by **us**, turn off the **energy** at **your** **premises** to enable access for the purposes referred to above.

7.3 Except in routine situations (such as reading or inspecting a **meter** that is located on the outside of a building) or emergency situations, before accessing **your** **premises**, either **we**, the **meter** company, **network company** and/or the other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises**, will provide written notice to **you** of:

• when access to **your** **premises** will be required; and
• the purpose for requiring access to **your** **premises**.

7.4 **We** will give **you** at least 10 working days notice of the intention to access **your** **premises** if the reason for requiring access relates to construction, upgrade, repair or maintenance.  Where **we** require access to **your** **premises** for any other reason (except for routine situations or emergency situations), **we** will give **you** reasonable notice.

7.5 Where **we** require access to **your** **premises**, **we** will:
• take reasonable steps to minimise any direct impacts on **your** property and any inconvenience to **you**; and

• try to comply with any reasonable requirements that **you** have given **us** (such as closing gates etc). 

7.6 Where **we** are able to, **we** will instruct the **metering company** or **network company** to take such steps and comply with such requirements.

When accessing **your** property, our representatives will act in a courteous, considerate and professional manner at all times.  

For more information on **energy** safety matters, contact the Energy Safety Service or the **network company**. 

7.7 Any of our representatives or any representatives of a **meter company** or the **network company** or other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises** who are requesting access to **your** **premises** will carry identification and present their identification to **you** on request. If our representatives are visiting at **your** request and **you** are at **your** **premises**, they will identify themselves to **you** before entering **your** property (and **we** will procure that any representatives of a **meter company** or the **network company** and/or other third parties who own **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises** requesting access to **your** **premises** will also identify themselves to **you**).  In all other circumstances, **you** can ask the representative(s) to identify themselves at any time while they are on **your** property.  If they are unable or unwilling to show **you** their identification, **you** should not give them access.

7.8 What if we have problems gaining access to your premises?

If **you** are not able to grant **us** access, please contact **us** to discuss alternative access options.

If **you** do not provide access to **your** **meter** or to any other **meters** (where **you** control access to those other **meters**) **we**  may charge **you** for any callout fees where **we** could not gain access, and such refusal will be considered a material breach of these terms and conditions for which **we** may disconnect **your** supply.

7.9 What if we can't read the meter? 

If **we** have been unable to obtain a reading from the **meter** for any reason, the amount of **energy** **you** have used may be estimated by **us** and **you** will be charged on the basis of our estimate. **You** can, however, provide **us** with a **meter** reading via our website or by calling **us**.

7.10 What if we hold keys to your premises?

If **we** have a key or security information to enable **us** to gain access to **your** **premises**, **we** will be responsible for its safe keeping and will use it only for the purposes described in this section 7. **We** will comply with any direction from **you** to return or destroy keys that **you** have given **us**, and/or the **meter company** or the **network company**.

7.11 What if you wish to turn off your electricity at the mains? 

Switching off **your** **energy** at the mains affects our ability to read **your** **advanced meter** remotely. **You** should only switch off **your** **energy** at the mains for essential maintenance or in the case of an emergency situation. If **you** wish to turn off **your** **energy** at the mains for longer than a week, **you** should contact **us** so **we** can explain how to turn off the **energy** at the **advanced meter**.

8 HOW WILL WE INVOICE YOU?
8.1 **We** will send **you** an invoice for payment on a monthly basis unless **we** have agreed otherwise. **Your** invoice will be delivered to the address provided by **you**.

**Your** invoice will show:

• a breakdown of the **energy** charges into gas and electricity (if **you** are supplied with both by **us**);
• the fixed charge component (if any) of **your** invoice including the quantity of **energy** supplied (or estimated to have been supplied);
• any charges for goods or services **you** have asked **us** to provide other than **energy** and lines services;
• a clear due date; and
• the identifier number of all installation control points on **your** property.

8.2 Any penalties or other charges that are additional to our usual fees will be separately itemised on **your** invoice.  **We** cannot tell **you** who **your** **network company** is on **your** invoice.  However, if **you** would like to know who **your** **network company** is, please call our Customer Care Team on 0800 086 400.

8.3 Our charges for **energy** consumption will be based on either an actual **meter** reading or an estimate of the **energy** consumed. Any estimate will be based on previous consumption if available or will be determined by following generally accepted industry practices and it will normally be clearly stated on **your** invoice if an estimate is used. 

**You** must pay the total amount shown on each invoice (including GST).  Payment must be received by **us** by the due date specified on the invoice, whether the invoice is based on an actual or estimated **meter** reading. **You** may not deduct or set off any amount from the amount shown on the invoice.

8.4 What if you have a dispute? 

If **you** dispute any amount payable under an invoice, **you** must give **us** notice at least 3 business days prior to the due date of the invoice, identifying the amount in dispute, and giving full reasons for the dispute. **We** will investigate **your** dispute as quickly as possible. 

If **you** dispute the amount on **your** invoice, or any part of **your** invoice, **you** must still pay the undisputed amount by the due date. 

**We** will not stop supplying **you** with **energy** if there is a genuine dispute between **us** in relation to an invoice and **you** have paid **us** any undisputed amount by the due date. Within 10 days of resolving any dispute about **your** invoice, **we** will credit your account with any amount **we** owe **you**, or **you** will pay **us** any amount **you** owe **us**, unless agreed otherwise.

8.5 What if you don't pay? 

**We** will try to help **you** in making payment arrangements with **us**, but if **you** do not pay amounts due to **us**, **we** may disconnect or limit **your** supply (see section 11.1 below) and **you** may incur fees for disconnection and debt collection. If circumstances arise, or are likely to arise, that mean **you** may incur a fee for disconnection or debt collection, **we** will provide reasonable notice to **you** that such a fee will be payable.

Any costs incurred in collecting money owing to **us** by **you**, including bank fees, credit agency fees and legal and court costs, are payable by **you**. 

If **you** are having difficulties in paying **your** invoice to **us** because **you** are a low income customer or a vulnerable customer, **you** may arrange for payment alternatives. Please call our Customer Care Team to discuss alternative payment methods. 

If **you** are a vulnerable customer, **we** will not disconnect **your** **energy** supply unless all assistance with payment has been given under section 14 of this agreement.

If **you** have verified **your** status as a medically dependent customer with **us**, **we** will not disconnect **your** electricity supply. In order to verify **your** status as a medically dependent customer, **you** will need to provide **us** with a Notice of Potential Medically Dependent Consumer Status Form.  **You** can request this form from **your** primary healthcare provider.  **We** may ask **you** to re-confirm **your** status as a medically dependent customer by providing **us** with a further Notice of Potential Medically Dependent Consumer Status Form no more than once every 12 months.

8.6 What if you don't receive an invoice or your invoice was late?

If **you** have not received an invoice, **you** should contact **us**.  If **we** determine that **you** are not responsible for the lateness of an invoice and:

• the invoice is sent more than two months after the end of the period to which it relates, **you** will have at least the length of time covered by the invoice to pay it; or
• ­the invoice is more than three months late, **we** will give **you** a discount of 5%.

8.7 What if your invoice is based on an estimate? 

If **your** invoice is based on our estimate of **your** **energy** consumption, **your** invoice will normally state clearly that an estimate has been used.  **You** may still pay for the exact amount of **energy** **you** have used by reading **your** own **meter** and advising **us** of **your** **meter** reading.  **We** will send **you** a new invoice based on this **meter** reading (unless **we** believe it is not correct), and **you** agree to pay the amount shown on that new invoice.  **You** can contact **us** if **you** would like a simple explanation of how any estimate has been calculated.  

8.8 What if your invoice is wrong? 

If **your** invoice is incorrect, **you** are only liable to pay the correct amount and **we** will refund any amount that **we** have over-charged, or **you** will pay any amount that **we** have under-charged. Any refunds for amounts that **we** have over-charged will be made promptly.  **We** may offset against any refund any amounts **you** owe **us** (or any debt collection agency to whom **we** have transferred any debt owing to **us** by **you**). Any amounts that **you** are required to pay because **we** have under-charged **you** will take into account whether **you** have contributed to the error in any way or could reasonably have been expected to know of the error.  

This does not apply where **your** invoice is based on an estimate of **your** **energy** consumption, as an adjustment will be made automatically in the next invoice based on an actual **meter** reading. In any event, **you** will be responsible for the payment of all of the **energy** **you** use.

8.9 Is interest payable? 

No interest is due on any amounts over-paid or under-paid by **you** or **us** in relation to incorrect or late invoices.

8.10 Payment if meter is faulty 

If **your** **meter** is faulty, **we** may not be able to tell for certain how much **energy** has actually been used. Therefore:

• ­subject to section 23, **you** will be liable, in relation to the variable rate component of **your** price plan, for the quantity measured by the **meter**, unless **you** contributed to the fault, or could have reasonably been expected to know about the fault. In addition, you will still be liable for the fixed daily rate component of **your** price plan; and
• ­if it is apparent that **your** **meter** has measured more **energy** than **you** actually used and **you** have over-paid **us**, **we** will refund to **you** an amount **we** reasonably believe is a realistic estimate of the over-payment.

9 WHAT FEES AND CHARGES WILL YOU PAY?
9.1 **You** must pay the fees and charges set out in the **Energy Online** price list based on the **energy** **you** consume and the services **you** use unless **we** have agreed otherwise in writing. These fees and charges may change from time to time. 

Please call our Customer Care Team, or click here, for a copy of our most recent price list.  **You** can contact **us** to check if **you** are on the right pricing plan for **your** requirements. 

9.2 **We** don’t offer prepay pricing plans.  If **you** are interested in a prepay pricing plan, **you** may wish to contact another **energy** retailer to see if they can offer y**ou** a prepay pricing plan in **your** area. 

Please contact **us** if **you** would like to change **your** pricing plan, products, or services.  If **you** do change pricing plans the change will be effected as soon as possible. If you choose to change **your** pricing plan more than once in any 12 month period a charge may be payable.

9.3 If circumstances arise, or are likely to arise, which mean that **you** may incur an additional fee, **we** will provide reasonable notice to **you** specifying the amount of the fee and the reason why **you** may incur the fee, and any steps **you** can take to avoid incurring the fee.  If **you** request a product or service that involves an additional cost, **we** will advise **you** of the amount of such additional cost where that cost is known, or provide an estimate of the cost (unless the cost is from a third party and that third party does not provide an estimate).

10 HOW DO YOU PAY YOUR INVOICE?

**You** may pay **your** invoice by any of the methods described in the welcome pack sent to **you** when **you** became our customer, as updated from time to time on our website. If you would like to receive further details, please call our Customer Care Team.

11 WHEN WILL WE DISCONNECT YOUR SUPPLY?
11.1 In addition to our, the **network company's** and the **meter company's** other rights of disconnection under this agreement, **your** **energy** supply may be disconnected: 

• ­for non payment of the undisputed portion of any invoice associated with the supply of **energy**, lines services or other services supplied to **you**;
• ­if **we** cease to have an agreement with the **network company** that provides lines services to **you**;
• ­for a planned or unplanned supply interruption (including for safety reasons); or
• ­if **you** materially or persistently breach any term of this agreement.

If **you** materially or persistently breach a term of this agreement in a way that is capable of being remedied, **we** will give **you** notice of the steps **you** can take to avoid the disconnection of **your** **energy** and/or termination of this agreement and **you** will have 5 business days to remedy the breach in accordance with the notice.

If an **advanced meter** has been installed at **your** **premises**, **we** may disconnect **your** supply of **energy** remotely.

11.2 Will we tell you about disconnecting your supply? 

Except in the case of an emergency situation or for safety reasons, or where **we** suspect the **metering equipment** or other equipment at **your** **premises** supplied by **us** or a **network company** or **meter company** has been tampered or interfered with, **we** will tell **you** at least 7 days (and allow a further 3 days for delivery of the notice) before **we** disconnect **your** supply of **energy**. **We** will also contact **you**, at the contact details provided by **you**, to provide **you** with a final warning at least 24 hours prior to disconnecting **your** supply. If disconnection is not prevented by **you** and not completed within the timeframe notified to **you** (including where **we** grant **you** an extension to that timeframe, at our discretion), **we** will issue **you** with another final warning no less than 24 hours, or not more than 7 days, before disconnection. Any notice of disconnection from **us** will include information that **you** need to prevent disconnection if prevention is possible.  **We** may ask **you** to pay a disconnection fee or an attendance fee (where the disconnection does not proceed) in respect of the action taken by **us** under this section. **We** will provide reasonable notice to **you** if **you** are likely to incur a disconnection fee.

**We** will not disconnect **your** supply for non-payment of a disputed amount where **you** have initiated a dispute with the Electricity & Gas Complaints Commissioner in relation to that disputed amount, unless the Electricity & Gas Complaints Commissioner dispute resolution process or our own dispute resolution process has been exhausted.

**We** will only disconnect **your** supply for non-payment of an invoice based on an estimate if it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances to do so. 
Where **we** disconnect **your** electricity under this section 11 (other than in the case of an emergency situation or for safety reasons), such disconnection will not take place on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, public holiday or the day before any public holiday in **your** area. 

If **your** supply has been disconnected for non-payment and **you** satisfy our requirements for reconnection (see section 12), **we** will restore **your** supply as soon as reasonably practicable.

11.3 Can the network company also disconnect your supply? 

The **network company** is entitled to disconnect **your** supply if:

• **you** fail to grant the rights of access specified in this agreement; 
• **your** equipment does not meet the **network company's** requirements; 
• requested to do so by **us**; 
• an emergency situation occurs;
• it considers **your** equipment to be unsafe; or 
• **you** materially breach any other term of this agreement including the **network** requirements, and **you** agree that in respect of **your** electricity supply, section 105 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 shall not apply in respect of such disconnection. 

12 HOW DO YOU RESUME SUPPLY?
When **you** want to start **your** **energy** supply again, please call **us**. **You** may not attempt to reconnect the **energy** supply yourself. Before **we** agree to reconnect **your** **energy** supply **we** may require **you** to:

• be present at the time of reconnection;
• pay all outstanding amounts;
• pay a bond;
• pay a reconnection fee;
• turn off all appliances at **your** **remises**; and/or
• agree to a payment plan or any other reasonable requirements.

Where **you** have met these requirements **we** will arrange to reconnect **your** **energy** supply as soon as possible. 

If an **advanced meter** has been installed at **your** **premises**, **we** may reconnect **your** **energy** supply remotely. 

**You** will be responsible for any liability suffered or incurred by **you** as a result of **us** disconnecting or reconnecting the **energy** supply at **your** **premises**.

13 WHAT IF YOU WANT TO STOP YOUR SUPPLY?
13.1 If **you** no longer want **us** to supply **you** with **energy** or **you** want **your** supply disconnected, **you** must let **us** know at least 3 business days beforehand. This timeframe is consistent with applicable regulations and industry standards as at the date of these terms.  If **you** intend to leave **your** present **premises**, **you** must also tell **us** **your** forwarding address. 

If **you** don’t give **us** 3 business days' notice **you** will be required to pay for any **energy** used at the **premises** while the **premises** remain connected to the **network**, even if **you** are no longer at the **premises**, until the date on which 3 business days' notice has been given. 

If **you** are not going to remain our customer after **your** move, our charges to **you** will stop on the date 3 business days after **you** have given **us** notice in accordance with this section, or if **you** have failed to give **us** notice, when **we** disconnect the **premises**, or a new customer has notified **us** that it has taken over the **premises**.  Where **you** have given **us** notice in accordance with this section, disconnection of **your** **premises** will occur as soon as possible on or from the date on which **your** notice takes effect.

Where **you** have instructed **us** that **you** are switching to another retailer, **we** will work with **you** to facilitate the switch and terminate **your** supply in accordance with applicable regulations and industry standards. 

13.2 What if you want to stop receiving electricity where **we** also supply you with gas? 

**We** will only supply gas to **your** **premises** if **we** also supply **your** **premises** with electricity, therefore, if **you** no longer wish to receive electricity from **us**, **we** will also terminate our supply of gas to **you**.   **You** must provide **us** with at least 3 business days notice to terminate supply.

If the **energy** supply at **your** **premises** is disconnected (but not decommissioned), **we** may still charge **you** a daily fixed charge. However, **we** will not charge **you** a daily fixed charge for **energy** if the **energy** supply at **your** **premises** has been decommissioned.

13.3 Will a final meter reading be taken? 

**We** will arrange for a final **meter** reading and **we** will send a final invoice to **you** at **your** forwarding address. **We** may ask **you** to pay a final **meter** reading fee.  **We** will give **you** reasonable notice that **you** may incur a final **meter** reading fee and how **you** may avoid the fee if possible. 

14 CONTACTING WORK AND INCOME AND NOMINATED PERSON
**You** are a vulnerable customer if **you** have told **us**, or it appears to **us**, that disconnection of **energy** at **your** **premises** presents a clear threat to the health or well-being of **you** or a member of **your** household, or if **you** have mains powered equipment for critical medical support. This could be because of age, health or disability. **You** can inform **us** at any time if **you** are or become a vulnerable customer. 

If: 

• for any reason **we** form the honest belief that **you** are a vulnerable customer; and
• **you** do not make regular bill payments and **your** supply is at risk of disconnection; and
• **we** have provided **you** with all the assistance **we** are reasonably able to; and
• **you** are still unable to make **your** payments,

**you** authorise **us** to consult with Work and Income, District Health Boards, private health providers or any other social agency or service provider as necessary. 

**We** may also maintain **your** information on a register of vulnerable customers. If, after **we** have informed **you** of the opportunity to notify **us** that **you** are a vulnerable customer, **you** have not told **us**, or it does not appear to **us**, that **you** are a vulnerable customer, **we** will assume that **you** are not a vulnerable customer.

If **you** are not a vulnerable customer, **you** can still agree that **we** consult with Work and Income, District Health Boards, private health providers or any other social agency or service provider if:

• **you** do not pay **your** invoices regularly and **your** supply is at risk of disconnection; and
• **we** have provided **you** with all the assistance **we** are reasonably able to; and
• **you** are still unable to make **your** payments.

If **you** have nominated a person as an account authority with whom **we** can discuss the details of **your** account under section 2.5, **we** may also discuss financial assistance with that person.

17 WHAT IS ENERGY ONLINE’S LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE?
17.1 What will we be liable for? 

**We** will not be liable to **you** (in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) for any loss or damage **you** may suffer unless, and to the extent that, that loss or damage is direct loss of or damage to **your** physical property and it occurs due to:

• our breach of this agreement; or 
• our negligence;

and the loss or damage is:

• reasonably foreseeable and is directly caused by our breach or our negligence; and
• is not caused by something beyond our control,

but **we** will not be liable in any cases for any other loss or damage including indirect or consequential losses, loss of profits or revenue, or similar.

17.2 What is an event beyond our control? 

An event or cause beyond our control includes, but is not limited to: acts of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, accident, earthquake, fire, lightning, storm, flood or other similar event, interference with the **network** from birds, animals or vegetation, traffic accidents, faults in the **network**, acts or omissions by the **network company** or **meter company**, problems with generation, transmission or distribution of **energy**, problems with **your** wiring, problems arising because of health and safety hazards at **your** **premises**, and other things which **we** do not have control over. 

17.3 What is our maximum liability? 

If **we** are liable to **you**, the maximum amount **we** will pay as compensation for **your** loss is $10,000 in respect of any event or series of closely related events. **We** may choose to replace any damaged property or goods, up to the same maximum amount, instead of paying cash. **We** are not required to honour this agreement in circumstances where an event has occurred which is beyond our control and which prevents **us** from doing the things **we** would normally do. In these circumstances, **we** will carry on honouring our obligations as soon as it is reasonably practicable for **us** to do so. 

If **you** acquire goods or services from **us** for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, any rights **you** have under the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 are not affected by our limitations of liability. However, if **you** acquire goods or services from **us** for the purposes of a business, the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 does not apply. 

Our limitations of liability extend to our employees and agents for the purposes of the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982. 

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this agreement, nothing in this agreement will exclude or limit the application of any law in New Zealand where such law applies to the supply of **energy**, or any other services **we** supply, to the extent that to do so would:

• contravene that law; or 
• cause any part of this section 17 to be void.

18 CAN WE CHANGE THIS AGREEMENT?
18.1 **We** may make changes to this agreement, the **network** **requirements**, **your** payment methods, or our price list. If **we** make changes to this agreement, the **network** **requirements**, **your** payment methods, or if **we** increase the **energy** prices set out in our price list, **we** will give **you** notice of the changes as soon as possible and not later than 30 days before the change is to take effect, together with our reasons for making the changes. We will do this by any reasonable method of communication including by:

• advertising in a local daily newspaper; or 
• posting a notice on our website; or
• writing to **you**; or
• emailing **you**; or
• notifying **you** by other electronic means,

or by a combination of these methods.

18.2 If **we** increase the special fees or charges set out in our price list **we** will notify **you** of these changes by advertising on our website or placing a statement on **your** invoice. **We** do not need to give **you** notice if **we** decrease **your** **energy** prices or the special fees and charges set out in our price list. 

18.3 If **we** increase a fee or service charge by more than 5% or if **we** increase the total invoiced price for **energ**y **we** supply to **you** by more than 5% (and, in the case of a fee or service charge, the increase is reasonably likely to have a material effect on **you**), or change the frequency of billing or **meter** reading, **we** will always give **you** an individual written notice as soon as possible. However, **we** will not provide individual written notice of price increases where **you** have signed up to a flexible pricing plan, under which electricity prices may vary depending on the time and volume of **your** electricity consumption. **We** will not change the frequency of billing to less than approximately once a month (depending on when your **meter** is read) unless **you** have agreed otherwise, except for any one-off circumstances where it is necessary to send **you** a bill other than on a monthly basis.  If there has been an increase in **your** **energy** prices, the notice will explain the reasons for the increase. 

19 CAN YOU TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES?
19.1 This agreement may not be transferred or assigned by **you** to any other person.

**We** may transfer to someone else all or any part of our rights and responsibilities under this agreement. **We** may also sub-contract or delegate our responsibilities under this agreement to other people or companies.  Where **we** transfer our rights and responsibilities under this agreement, **we** will advise **you** that the agreement is being transferred to another company, where **you** can access the information **you** need to contact the new company and when the transfer will take place.  If, for any reason, **we** have, or **we** are likely to have, a receiver, liquidator or other similar officer appointed, **we** will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the supply of **your** **energy** is not affected.

19.2 In addition to the above, the Electricity Authority is able to assign our rights and obligations in respect of the supply of electricity to **you** under these terms to another electricity retailer in the event that **we** commit an "event of default", as that term is defined in the Electricity Code.  In the event that such an assignment occurs, the terms on which **you** will be supplied with electricity by the recipient retailer will be amended to the standard terms that the recipient retailer would normally have offered to **you** immediately before the relevant "event of default" occurred (or such other terms that are more advantageous to **you** than the recipient retailer's standard terms, as the recipient retailer and the Electricity Authority agree).  On such an assignment, these terms may be amended to include a minimum term in respect of which **you** must pay an amount if **you** wish to cancel these terms prior to the expiry of that minimum term.  **We** may provide information about **you** to the Electricity Authority (and the Electricity Authority may pass this information on to the recipient electricity retailer), if required under the Electricity Code.

19.3 The terms set out in section 19.2 are included for the benefit of the Electricity Authority for the purposes of the Contracts (Privity) Act 1982 and may not be amended without the consent of the Electricity Authority.

21 GETTING OUR ENERGY TO YOU
21.1 The **network companies** and **meter** companies **we** work with require **us** to ensure that the information contained below is agreed to by **you**. When **you** become our customer, **you** agree to those arrangements as part of this agreement. 

The **network company** owns and operates the **network** which transports **energy** to **your** **premises**. **We** will make arrangements with the **network company** to use the **network** and get our **energy** to **you**. 

21.2 Do you need an agreement with the network company?

In some cases, the **network company** may require **you** to have an agreement directly with it to use the **network**. If this is the case, **we** will provide **you** with the contact details of the **network company**, and:

• **you** must ensure that **you** have such an agreement; and
• our agreement will cover the supply of **energy** only.

**You** agree to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements and the **network company's** distribution code or other similar connection standards (a copy of the code or standards may be obtained from the **network company**). 

**You** must also comply with the **network company's** technical requirements and specifications for connection to the **network** which are published from time to time.  This information can be obtained from the **network company**.  **You** can contact **us** to find out who **your** **network company** is.

21.3 Interference with the network 

**You** must not, without the prior written consent of the local **network company**:

• attempt to send or receive signals or other forms of communication through the **network**;
• install electricity generating equipment that will export **energy** back into the **network**;
• connect or re-connect **your** equipment directly to the **network**; or 
• interfere in any other way with the **network**.

**You** must not, without our prior written consent, connect or modify any fittings or other equipment on **your** **premises** to enable any electricity generated on the **premises** to be conveyed through the **network**.

21.4 Some technical requirements relating to electricity 

In relation to **your** electricity supply, **you** agree that:

• the power factor shall not be less than 0.95 lagging each month, or such other amount as specified by **your** local **network company**;
• there is to be no interconnection at any time between **your** point of supply and any other point of supply without the **network company's** prior written consent;
• if the characteristics of **your** equipment or demand interferes with the quality of supply of **energy** to any other consumer on the **network** or interferes with the operation of any remote signalling services or other fittings of the **network company**, **you** will, upon notice from the **network company** or **us**, remedy the interference at **your** own cost as soon as practicable (and in any event within 20 business days of the date of the notice). If **we** become liable to any third party as a result of such interference, **you** must compensate **us** to the full extent of such liability and for all associated costs incurred by **us**; 
• **you** will use all reasonable measures to ensure that the levels of harmonic voltages and currents injected back into the **network** from **your** **premises** conform with the New Zealand Electrical Code of Practice for Harmonic levels NZECP 36:1993 insofar as the harmonic disturbance results from a cause within **your** control; and
• **you** agree to comply with all line function services, safety and technical requirements provided for under statute, regulations and codes of practice. 

For more information contact the **network company**.

22 WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ABOUT SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT?
There may be planned or unplanned events which may cause outages or voltage fluctuations which could damage sensitive electrical appliances like computers, televisions, videos, cordless phones, computerised appliances and fridges and freezers. Voltage fluctuations can occur at any time and may be caused by events beyond our control, such as the events listed in section 17.2 above.

**You** should consider arranging insurance that covers damage from power fluctuations, install **your** own back-up devices such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), and / or make other arrangements to protect **your** equipment or meet **your** special needs. Power conditioners and surge protectors may help reduce such fluctuations and can be plugged into appliances or wired into **your** house mains. Further information regarding protection that **you** may take against outages or voltage fluctuations, and information on high-risk areas, is available by visiting our website. 

**We** take no responsibility for any loss or damage caused to equipment or appliances, including loss of data, arising from these kinds of fluctuations.

23 METERING EQUIPMENT AND NETWORK COMPANY EQUIPMENT
23.1 The **energy** supplied to **you** will be **metered**. Different pricing options may require separate **meters**. **We**, or the **metering** company, will retain all ownership rights in any **meter** and **metering equipment** installed at **your** **premises**.  All **electricity and gas** **meters** will comply with applicable regulations and good industry practice.  

23.2 If **you** do not have a suitable **meter** for **your** **energy** use or pricing option **we** will choose and arrange to install the appropriate **meter**. **You** may not provide or install **your** own **meter**. **You** must pay all reasonable costs relating to the installation of any **metering equipment**. However, **you** will not be charged:

• for the installation of the first **advanced meter** at **your** **premises**, unless additional work is required to install the **meter** or **metering equipment** (this includes additional wiring required to install the **meter **or work required to re-locate the position of the **metering equipment**) in which case **we** may charge **you** for this additional work;
• where **we** decide to replace **meters** or related equipment if the existing **meters** or related equipment are unsuitable for **your** **energy** use or pricing option. In some cases it may be necessary to upgrade **your** **meter** if **your** **energy** use or pricing option changes. **We** may charge **you** the costs of installing a new **meter**. **We** will inform **you** if any upgrade is required and the costs of that upgrade.

23.3 If **you** request that a new **meter** be installed **you** will be charged for the installation of that new **meter** (as well as the cost of the new **meter**).

23.4 How should you deal with equipment at your premises?

**You** must ensure that any **metering equipment** which is supplied by **us** or a **meter company**, and any **energy** supply equipment of the **network company** or any other third party:

• is not removed from its location without our consent;
• is not encumbered or used as security in any way;
• is not, and does not, become a fixture or fitting of the **premises**; and
• is not switched off other than in accordance with section 7.11 above.

**You** agree:

• to provide **us**, the **meter company**, **network company** and any other third party who owns **energy** supply equipment on **your** **premises** with reasonable space for the safe, secure, weather tight, insect and vermin free, and accessible housing of the **metering equipment** and the equipment of the network company or other third party at no cost to **us**, and ensure the housing remains in such condition; and
• to look after the **meter** and prevent interference with, or damage to, or loss of, the **metering equipment**, the **energy** supply equipment of the **network company** or other third party and the metering communications network.

If **you** do not own **your** **premises**, you confirm that **you** have any necessary approvals required from the owner, landlord or body corporate for the installation of any **meter** or **metering equipment** at **your** **premises**, for any alterations to **your** **premises** required to install any such equipment and to enable **us** to exercise our other rights under these terms and conditions. **You** will bear any costs incurred by **us**, the **meter company**, **network company** or our respective contractors if **you** do not have any such approval.

23.5 What if the meter is damaged?
