# Electricity (Hazards from Trees) Regulations 2003
## Purpose
The purpose of these regulations is to protect the security of the supply of electricity, and the safety of the public, by:

- prescribing distances from electrical conductors within which trees must not encroach;
- setting rules about who has responsibility for cutting or trimming trees that encroach on electrical conductors;
- specifying who is liable if those rules are breached; and
- providing an arbitration system to resolve disputes between electricity retailers, network companies and tree owners about the operation of the regulations.


## How the regulations work
The regulations set out the circumstances in which the network company or we may warn you of a tree encroaching a specified zone, or the circumstances where the network company or we must give a "cut or trim" notice to you. The purpose of a cut or trim notice is to notify you (the tree owner) that a tree is encroaching a growth limit zone and must be cut or trimmed.

## How the regulations affect you
If you receive a cut or trim notice, it will contain all the information you need to comply with the regulations, including:

- an explanation of the growth limit zone in relation to the electrical conductor and the tree to which the notice relates;
- the time limits within which you must cause the tree to be cut or trimmed;
- an explanation of the obligations of the electricity retailer or network company (as applicable);
- what to do if you have no interest in the tree or how to get a dispensation from cutting or trimming the tree;
- how to contact an arbitrator if you have applied for a dispensation and disagree with the decision; and
- a summary of your liability under the regulations.

## Liability of tree owners
A tree owner commits an offence if he or she is given a cut or trim notice in relation to a tree that requires the tree owner to cut or trim the tree, and the tree owner:

- fails, without reasonable excuse, to cause the tree to be cut or trimmed in accordance with the regulations;
- fails, without reasonable excuse, to advise the electricity retailers or network company (as applicable) the time and location of the cutting or trimming of the tree.
