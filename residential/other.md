## I have a medical device (e.g. oxygen pump/dialysis machine), so I require a constant electricity supply for health reasons. What do I need to do?
Please contact our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) and let us know what type of medical device you have. We will record this information against your account and will use our best endeavors to ensure you are notified if the network performs any planned maintenance work which may interrupt the supply of electricity. However, we are **unable** to guarantee continuous supply as a fault may occur on the network – we suggest you make a contingency plan for this scenario, while the network will endeavor to ensure your supply is restored as soon as possible.

## I've lost the Terms and Conditions that you've sent me in the mail; do you have this available online?
