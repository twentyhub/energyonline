# Low user

## What is the difference between Standard and Low User electricity Price Plans?
Our Low User electricity Price Plan has been designed to benefit customers who use 8,000 units of electricity (kWh) or less per annum. In accordance with the government’s regulations, the daily charge is 30 cents a day (excluding GST and after the application of the Prompt Payment Discount). Our Low User electricity Price Plan is only available for the primary residence of the account holder.

If you use more than 8,000 units of electricity (kWh) per annum, then the Energy Online Standard User electricity Price Plan will be more economic for you.

## How do I know if I use less than 8,000 kWh of electricity per annum?
If you are an Energy Online customer, you will find this information on your invoice, below the graph on the left hand side.

For customers who have been in their current property for less than a year, you can multiply your average monthly usage by 12 months to give you an estimated annual consumption. Please remember that most customers experience an increase in electricity use over the winter months so you need to take this into consideration if you have only been in your property during the summer months.

You will need to consider any upcoming changes to your circumstances that may affect your usage. New appliances, changes in the number of people living at the property, and the amount of time those people spend at the property are all examples of factors that could affect your average electricity usage.  

## Can I have the Low User electricity Price Plan at my Bach?
Unfortunately, no. The Low User electricity Price Plan is only available for your primary place of residence, so secondary properties and installations such as holiday homes, pumps and sheds are ineligible.

## Is there a charge to change the Price Plan I am on?
To change the Price Plan you are on involves both Energy Online and your local network company making changes to their database and billing systems. Many network companies charge Energy Online to make a change to your Price Plan.

The good news is that we’ve decided that your first Price Plan change in a 12 month period will be at no charge to you. However, any subsequent changes within the same 12 month period will incur a plan change fee. Our latest schedule of fees can be found here.

## If I use more than 8,000 kWh of electricity per annum, does it change to a Standard User electricity Price Plan automatically?
No it doesn’t. This is a reason why we ask you to make any decision to change Price Plans carefully. Be sure to think about your previous usage patterns and if there are any circumstances you might expect to change, such as changes to the number of people in your house, or the types of appliances used, for example, night store or under floor heating.

## Why are my winter accounts higher on a Low User electricity Price Plan?
If you are on our Low User electricity Price Plan, you may find there is a slight increase in your winter account. Because the unit rate for your Low User electricity Price Plan is higher than the unit rate in our Standard User electricity Price Plan, your account may increase slightly during winter.

However, if you use 8,000 units or less in 12 months the total amount you will have been charged for your electricity for those 12 months will be lower than if you were on our Standard User electricity Price Plan.
