# Meter reads
## How often will my meter be read?
We will make every effort to read your meter on a regular basis if there are no access issues.

We are happy to take a meter reading from you at any time.  There are several ways for you to provide a reading to us; you can either log on to your account online, [email, fax or phone](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) through your reading to us.

## Why is my meter not being read?
The most common reason for Energy Online not being able to read your meter is due to access issues; your meter may be in a location that is difficult for our meter readers to access.

There can be a number of reasons for access issues.

If your meter/s are inside a locked building, or you have had a locked gate installed, a copy of the key can be provided to Energy Online for the sole purpose of obtaining meter reads at your property.  If you send us a copy of your key, please include your customer number and a brief description as to which door this key is for.  For safety reasons, please do not include details of your address.  If you'd like any further assistance, please [contact us](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66).

If you have a dog on your property, our meter reader may not feel confident entering its territory to get your meter read.  If this is the case, please [contact](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) Energy Online so we can advise what approximate dates the meter reader is due so that you may restrain your dog during this period.

If neither situation above applies, please contact our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) and we will investigate the situation with our meter readers.

## When should I provide a meter read?
We are happy to take a meter reading from you at any time, but several working days before the end of your billing period is best.  There are several ways for you to provide a reading to us; you can either log on to your account online, [email, fax or phone](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) through your reading to us.

## Why is my invoice higher than usual?
There can be many reasons for an invoice to be higher than usual.  Here are a few things you can check to discover why your invoice may be unusually high:

- Is there an overdue portion on your invoice?  Last month's invoice may not have been paid or perhaps your payment has not been received by us.
- Compare the reading on your meter/s to the read you have been billed to - the read you have been billed to can be located on your invoice in the Electricity/Gas Usage Details section, and is the number in the column titled "This Bill".  If you would like to discuss the difference between the reading on your meter and the read you have been billed to please contact our Customer Care Team.
- Your hot water thermostat may not be set correctly - it should be set between 55°C and 65°C - any colder and bacteria can grow in the cylinder, any higher and you will be heating the water unnecessarily.
- Using heaters or clothes dryers for extended periods can lead to an increase in your invoice.
- You have recently acquired an appliance that heats or cools (these types of appliances typically have high energy usage).
- If the temperature of the water coming out of your tap has recently increased you may have a problem with the thermostat on your hot water cylinder.
- If your hot water cylinder overflow pipe is dumping steaming water, your hot water cylinder is constantly boiling water that is going to waste.  This will increase your Energy Online invoice.
- Dripping taps or leaky pipes can be contributing factors to a higher invoice.
