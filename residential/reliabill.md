# ReliaBill®
ReliaBill® is a “set and forget” payment plan that allows you to manage your energy account payments with greater certainty.

We direct debit a fixed amount from your bank account on a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly basis for a period of twelve months from the agreed start date of the arrangement. The agreed amount will be calculated to cover your expected annual electricity costs and the arrangement remains in place for twelve months - you may also include any overdue balances at the time your ReliaBill® arrangement is set up.

As part of your ReliaBill® payment arrangement your prompt payment discounts will be automatically credited to your account. However, if any scheduled payments are missed then we may reverse the part of the prompt payment discount given for the missed payment.

At the end of the twelve months, when your ReliaBill® payment arrangement expires, it is reviewed to determine a new arrangement for the coming twelve months. If there is a credit balance on your account we will arrange for this to be paid to your bank account or we can retain it for inclusion in the review process of any new arrangement. If there is a balance owing this may need to be paid or alternatively can be included in a new ReliaBill® arrangement for the following year.
