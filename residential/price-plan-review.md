# Energy Online Price Plan Review
At Energy Online we want to make sure you’re on the best pricing plan for your energy needs. Each year we’ll let you know how much electricity you’ve used in the previous 12 months and what our plan options are – so you can decide if you’re on the right plan for your home.

We have two different pricing plans available - Standard User and Low User.

If you wish to remain on your current user plan you don’t need to do anything; we will not change your pricing plan unless you ask us to.

If you wish to change the electricity pricing plan you are on, please submit an online request.

To be eligible for our Low User Plan the property must be the primary residence of the account holder; so holiday homes and non-residential sites such as sheds or pumps are not eligible.
