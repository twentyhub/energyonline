# Direct Debit
Paying by Direct Debit means, as long as there are sufficient funds in your bank account on the due date, you will always receive your Prompt Payment Discount.

There are two ways we can process your Direct Debit application.

If you have a personal bank account, we may be able to process your application online.  There are no forms to send; all you need to do is fill in the easy to follow form below and we'll take care of the rest. This can take up to seven days to complete.

Otherwise, you can download our Standard Direct Debit form below and send the completed form to Energy Online.  It will take approximately three weeks to load the form with your bank.

With both Direct Debit options you will need to keep paying your account how you have previously paid until you receive notification from us that the Direct Debit is in place.
