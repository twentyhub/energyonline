## Vulnerable customers
<p class="intro">If, for reasons of age, health, disability or severe financial insecurity, disconnection of electricity may present a clear threat to you or a member of your household’s health or well being, it’s important you contact our Customer Care Team. We will record this information against your account to better enable us to help you.</p>


## Preferred contacts
If you believe that you may have difficulties with your payments or with communicating with us in future, please provide details of a person or persons that can be contacted on your behalf who will be able to act as your advocate if a disconnection or payment issue is pending. This could be a family member or friend, or a social agency. Your preferred contact may also contact us on your behalf at any time to discuss your current situation and your ability to manage your account.

By giving us details of a preferred contact, you give Energy Online permission to discuss your account with the person or persons you’ve nominated — however we will only contact such persons in order to assist you if you are having difficulty communicating with us or paying your account.

You can add a preferred contact to your account by [contacting us](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) or by [logging on](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=77) to [My Account](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=204).

Please be assured, while dealing with authorised contacts or social agencies, we will ensure that we only discuss matters related to payment, and ensure any discussions are treated with discretion and sensitivity

## Having difficulty paying your invoice?
We understand that sometimes it can be difficult paying bills on time for a variety of reasons. We have a number of [payment options](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=61) available to help you. If you're having difficulty paying your account, please contact our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66).

You may also want to discuss your situation with a social agency such as Work and Income. They can be contacted on 0800 559 009. They will ensure that if you qualify, all financial or other assistance is provided to you.

You may also be able to receive assistance and advice from budgeting agencies. We would recommend that you check the Yellow Pages under Budgeting for an organisation near you.
