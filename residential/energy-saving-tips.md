# Residential energy saving tips
<p class="intro">Saving energy in your home doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to pay hundreds of dollars on the latest innovations. Yes, an investment into your property may give the biggest savings but there are some inexpensive measures that you can take and every bit helps.</p>


## Living areas

### Curtains
- Ensure your curtains cover the window to ensure there are no gaps to minimise heat loss.
- Thermal backed curtains are the best for minimising heat loss.
- Close your curtains at sundown to minimise heat loss.


### Draughts
- Make sure windows and doors are sealed properly; a hardware store has products available or you can make a ‘draught snake’ to place against doors which is as simple as stuffing a sock with material.
- Fill any gaps where cables or pipes exit an external wall.

### Other Tips
- Change to energy efficient light bulbs.
- Turn appliances off at the wall rather than leaving them on standby mode.
- Installation of a ceiling fan, this can help circulate warmer air in the winter and keep you cooler in the summer.
- Insulation - up to 33% of your heat can be lost through the ceiling, walls and floors, insulation will minimise this heat loss.
- Your local hardware store will be able to give you advice on the right insulation for your home.
- Installation of a heat pump - heat pumps are up to four times more energy efficient than plug-in heaters.
- Make the change to solar power.
- And remember, a dry home is easier and more efficient to heat and is better for your health too!


## Bathroom and laundry
### General
- Fix any taps or pipes that may be leaking.
- Keep your bathroom door closed to help prevent moisture spreading throughout your house.
- Installation of a 'low-flow' shower head may reduce water consumption if you have mains pressure hot water supply.
- A shower is generally more efficient than a bath because it uses less water.

### Hot Water Cylinder
- The optimum temperature for your hot water cylinder is 55-60 degrees Celsius, any lower and bacteria will breed, any higher and the water may be heating more frequently than required which will increase your account.
- Use a hot water cylinder wrap to prevent heat loss.
- Wrap the pipes in your hot water cupboard with insulation foam, available from your hardware store.
- Check the overflow pipe (often located on the roof) regularly to ensure no dripping water. If the overflow pipe is dripping and/or steaming, this means hot water is being dumped - a plumber can fix this for you. If cold water is being dumped, the plumber can still fix it but it is less likely to seriously impact on your power bill.
- Switch off your hot water cylinder if you are going to be away from home for 10 days or more.


### Dryer
- Make sure your dryer is vented to the outside.
- Don't overload your dryer.
- If possible, buy a dryer that automatically senses when the clothes are dry.


### Washing Machine
- Where possible, use cold water to wash your clothes.
- If your washing machine has the functionality, change the water level to suit the size of the load you are washing.


## Kitchen
### Washing Dishes
- If you are doing a small number of dishes, use hot water from the kettle.
- Rinse dirty dishes in cold water rather than hot.
- It is generally more economical to use a dishwasher than to fill your kitchen sink three times.
- If your dish washer can be connected to cold water, it is more economical than transferring hot water from the cylinder through cold pipes.
- Only wash a full load of dishes in the dishwasher and use the economy setting.



### Cooking
- Use the element on the stove that matches the size of the pot you are cooking in.
- Use a minimal amount of water when you are simmering food.
- When cooking, use pot lids to stop the heat escaping.
- When using the oven, only open the door when absolutely necessary. Each time you open the door, the temperature drops about 15 degrees.
- Use your oven to cook more than one dish at a time.
- Try to use the microwave instead of the oven.
- Fill your kettle with only the amount of water needed.
- It is more economical to boil water in the kettle rather than on the hob.


### Fridge/Freezer
- If you can, it is a good idea to position your fridge away from the heat and direct sunlight.
- Set the fridge temperature between 2 and 5 degrees, and your freezer to -18 degrees.
- Frost free freezers are less energy efficient than cyclic freezers.
- Try not to open the doors too often or leave them open.
- Make sure that doors have a good seal.
- Don't overstock the fridge or freezer, the air needs to circulate.
- Let food cool before placing it in the fridge.
- If your fridge has coils, dust them regularly to keep it running efficiently.
