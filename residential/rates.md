## What is the difference between Standard and Low User electricity Price Plans?
Our Low User electricity Price Plan has been designed to be more economic for those customers who use 8,000 units of electricity (kWh) or less per annum.  In accordance with the government's regulations, the daily charge is 30 cents a day (excluding GST and after the application of the Prompt Payment Discount).  Our Low User electricity Price Plan is only available for the primary residence of the account holder.

If you use more than 8,000 units of electricity (kWh) per annum, then the Energy Online Standard User Price Plan will be more economic for you.

## Why has my last invoice got two different charges on it?
If Energy Online changed your prices during your billing period, you will have an invoice with pro-rata charging.  This is where we have charged the old rates up to the date of the change and the new rates after the change.

## Why are my rates different to my neighbours?
From time to time we vary our rates - if your neighbours signed up with Energy Online at a different time from you it is possible they may be on different tariffs.  For our current rates, please click [here](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=114).

## Why is my Prompt Payment Discount different to my neighbours?
The Prompt Payment Discount is one component that makes up the pricing plan you are on.  While your Prompt Payment Discount may differ to that of your neighbours, please compare all other aspects of your pricing plan, such as your Daily Charge and Unit Rate along with your Prompt Payment Discount.
