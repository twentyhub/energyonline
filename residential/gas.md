# Gas
<p class="intro">We’ve got great news - you may now be able to receive both natural gas and electricity supply through one Energy Online account!</p>


## Let's Get Started
Currently we provide gas supply to customers in selected regions like Greater Auckland, Hawke’s Bay, Wellington, Martin, Bulls, Horowhenua, Manawatu, Taranaki and Wanganui. We are working hard to be able to supply gas to our customers in other areas, so watch this space!

If you currently have a reticulated gas supply (gas through the pipe) in one of the areas mentioned above, and you'd like to sign up your gas supply with Energy Online, please [sign up online](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/home/join_us/online_signup_form) or contact us via email at <mailto:sales@energyonline.co.nz> or by phone on 0800 089 089.  If you would like to view our Gas pricing you can find it [here](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=207).

## Why Energy Online?
A lot of our customers have asked to have their gas supplied through Energy Online and we're pleased to bring you the convenience of having your gas and electricity on one invoice.

You’ll also get all the great benefits our electricity customers already receive, such as:

- Our 20% Prompt Payment Discount if you pay in full and on time each month; and
- The choice of receiving your invoices by email instead of by post which means you'll get the same information without the clutter of physical mail to sort and file; and
- Billing to actual meter readings every month where we both agree this option and we are able to access your meters, as well as
- Energy Online's great customer service for your gas supply as well!

## Safety
While gas is an efficient and safe form of energy, it's important you read some safety information about gas [here](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=224).
