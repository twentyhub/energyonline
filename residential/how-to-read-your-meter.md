# How to read your meter
<p class="intro">Your meter records the energy usage on your property, which our meter readers read regularly. However, you can take a reading of your meter yourself to track your consumption.</p>

There are a number of different types of electricity and gas meters. Some are digital meters and others show the reading using a series of dials.

On electricity meters the numbers on a meter represent kilowatt hours (or kWh) of electricity used. Kilowatt hours are often referred to as “units”.

On gas meters, the numbers represent the volume of gas used measured in cubic meters (or m³). We then convert this to kilowatt hours for billing.

## Digital Meter
This looks very much like the odometer in a car.

Read the numbers from left to right ignoring any number that is either coloured red or is distinctly different to the majority. These different numbers record the tenths or hundredths of a unit and are not used for billing purposes.

Examples of how to read a digital meter:

This meter reads 0756

86991.jpg

This meter reads 8699

## Clock dial meter
These meters are referred to as a clock dial meter as the dials look similar to clock faces.

Typically, these have the units labelled above or below each dial (e.g. 1000 = the thousands, 100 = hundreds etc). These should be read in the order of the highest units first, down to the lowest units. Please note the numbers on the faces go alternatively clockwise and anti-clockwise. When reading each clock, if the pointer is between 2 numbers, take the lower value of the two numbers. (When the pointer is between the 9 and 0 then consider the 0 to be 10.)

When the pointer looks like it is right on a number, for example 8, check the next dial to the right to see if the hand is before or after 0. If the pointer is before 0 then write down 7 not 8 (just like a clock, when it is 4:55, the hour hand looks like it is exactly on the 5 but the time is just before 5 o’clock).

Examples below of how to read a clock dial meter:

7976.jpg

This meter reads 7976
Although the first dial looks to be on the 8, as the following dial is just before the 0, this means the 1000’s dial is recorded as 7.

47206.jpg

This meter reads 47206
The 100’s position is right on the 2 and the 10’s position has moved past the 0. Record the 100's dial as reading 2.

## Access to meters
The most common reason for Energy Online not being able to read your meter is due to access issues; your meter may be in a location that is difficult for our meter readers to reach.

If your meter/s are inside a locked building, or you have had a locked gate installed, a copy of the key can be provided to Energy Online for the sole purpose of obtaining meter reads at your property. If you send us a copy of your key, please include your customer number and a brief description as to which door this key is for. For safety reasons, please do not include details of your address. If you'd like any further assistance, please [contact us](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66).

If you have a dog on your property, our meter reader may not feel confident entering its territory to get your meter read. If this is the case, please [contact](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) Energy Online so we can advise what approximate dates the meter reader is due so that you may restrain your dog during this period.

If neither situation above applies, please [contact us](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) and we will investigate the situation with our meter readers.

## Meter reading requirements
Energy Online has to remain compliant with the requirements of the Electricity Governance rules in respect of reading your meter. In particular:

- A meter read must be obtained for all meters at your property - this can include reads you supply to us.
- Meter readings must be obtained at least every 4 months. You can supply these readings, however, in addition to your readings we must also obtain a reading completed by our approved meter reading contractor at least once every 12 months.
If an appointment with our meter reader is required (that is, an arrangement is made to read on a particular date rather than part of the normal meter readers route) then a charge will be applicable. Please see our schedule of fees.
