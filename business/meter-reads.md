# Meter reads

## How often will my meter be read?
We will make every effort to read your meter on a regular basis if there are no access issues.

We are happy to take a meter reading from you at any time.  There are several ways for you to provide a reading to us; you can either log on to your account online, [email, fax or phone](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) through your reading to us.

## Why is my meter not being read?
If your meter/s are inside a locked building, or you have had a locked gate installed, a copy of the key can be provided to Energy Online for the sole purpose of obtaining meter reads at your property.  If you send us a copy of your key, please include your customer number and a brief description as to which door this key is for.  For safety reasons, please do not include details of your address.  If you'd like any further assistance, please [contact us](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66).

If your hours of operation are outside normal business hours then we may need to make special arrangements with our meter reading contractor to gain your reads during your hours of operation.

If neither situation above applies, please contact our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) and we will investigate the situation with our meter readers.

## When should I provide a meter read?
We are happy to take a meter reading from you at any time but several working days before the end of your billing period is best.  There are several ways for you to provide a reading to us; you can either log on to your account online, email, fax or phone through your reading to us.

## The meter reader visited my property last week, where is my bill?
Even though the majority of our business customers receive an invoice from us at the same time of the month, our meter reading schedule is divided up into routes that can be completed throughout the month.  This means that although you may receive your invoice early in the month, for example, your street may be on the schedule that is read in the third week of the month.

We will still read your meter on a regular basis and you are welcome to provide your own meter reads at any stage.

## Why is my invoice high?
There can be many reasons for a high invoice.  Here are a few things you can check to discover why your invoice may be unusually high:
- Is there an overdue portion on your invoice?  Last month's invoice may not have been paid or perhaps your payment has not been received by us at the time the invoice was printed.
- Compare the reading on your meter/s to the read you have been billed to - the read you have been billed to can be located on your invoice in the Electricity/Gas Usage Details section, and is the number in the column titled "This Bill".  If you would like to discuss the difference between the reading on your meter and the read you have been billed to please contact our Customer Care Team.
- Your hot water thermostat may not be set correctly - it should be set between 55°C and 65°C - any colder and bacteria can grow in the cylinder, any higher and you will be constantly heating the water unnecessarily.
Using heaters or air conditioning for extended periods can lead to an increase in your invoice.
- You have recently acquired an appliance that heats or cools (these types of appliances typically have high energy usage).
- If the temperature of the water coming out of your tap has recently increased you may have a problem with the thermostat on your hot water cylinder.
- If your hot water cylinder overflow pipe is dumping steaming water, your hot water cylinder is constantly boiling water that is going to waste.
- Dripping taps or leaky pipes can be contributing factors to a higher invoice.
- Check that staff turn their computers off when they leave at night
If you provide shower facilities for staff, are they being used for excessive periods?
