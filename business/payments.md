# Payments
## How often am I billed?
You will receive an invoice from us every calendar month. If you are changing to Energy Online from another energy retailer, it may take a few weeks for your switch to be completed so please keep making payments to your old energy supplier until the change is completed.

## When do I pay my account?
The due date for payment of your account is printed on your invoice and will normally be 18 days after the date your invoice is printed. Payments received by this date will qualify for our Prompt Payment Discount. If payment is not received by the due date the full amount of the invoice will be payable.

## I pay all business accounts the 20th of the following month. Can I still do this?
Yes, that will be fine. If you email or call our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66), we can arrange for the due date on your business account to be the 22nd of the month.
