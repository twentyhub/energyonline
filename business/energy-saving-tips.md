# Business energy saving tips
<p class="intro">Saving energy in your business doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to spend a lot of money on the latest innovations. Yes, an investment into your property may give the biggest savings, but there are some inexpensive measures that you can take. Every bit helps.</p>

## Lighting
- Regularly clean your lights and their fittings. Excess dust can reduce lighting efficiency by up to 30%
- Display lighting is energy intensive and often overused, consider installing a sensor that activates lights when a passer-by approaches rather than having it constantly illuminated.
- Use NG tri-phosper lighting where possible as this is more energy efficient than fluorescent lighting and will last longer than other lighting alternatives.
- Replace bulbs as they near the end of their life. As bulbs degrade, they get dimmer but use the same amount of energy.


## Air conditioning
- Check all windows and doors for draughts; ensure there are good seals around windows and doors as this will ensure your air conditioning works more efficiently.
- Ensure your air conditioning equipment has a clear space around it.
- The correct heat settings for your air conditioning are: heating 19°C, air conditioning 23-24°C, workshops 16°C and stores 10-12°C. Ask staff not to change the settings or get the thermostats locked. Ensure all units in the same area have the same setting.
- Avoid simultaneous heating and cooling; ensure that your air conditioning and heating controls don't conflict.
- Avoid placing thermostats near heat sources such as photocopiers, lighting, refrigerators, factory machinery, sunlight and heaters. If a sensor is placed in these positions it will make the air conditioning work for longer than necessary and use more energy.
- As heat rises, rooms with a higher ceiling will trap the warm air at ceiling level, use a fan to push this warmer air down or install false ceilings to lower their level.
- Adjust the timing controls of the air conditioning to start 30 minutes before your staff arrive in the morning and to stop 30 minutes before they leave at the end of the day.
- Mechanical ventilation and extractor fans can be costly to run. You may like to consider installing high efficiency fans. Check timer settings and time clocks.
- Clean and replace air filters regularly.
- Ensure regular maintenance of air conditioning units to catch any problems early.
- Consider heat recovery systems. A professional can advise you of the system that best meets your business needs.


## Computers, copiers and printers
- Ensure that staff know to turn computers off every night and at weekends.
Turn the monitor off if it isn't going to be used for longer than 15 minutes.
- Laptop computers use less energy than desk top computers.
- When buying or leasing office equipment, check that it has energy saving modes as this will help reduce energy consumption.
- Uninterruptible Power Supplies supply constant electricity to equipment; check you have the correct size as excess capacity will increase running costs.


## Other
- Adjust hot water temperature to 55°C.
- Fix any leaky hot water taps as the leak will waste water and energy.
- If your hot water cylinder is warm to the touch, wrap it with an insulation wrap and lag the 1st meter of pipe.
- Turn hot water off if your business will be closed for longer than 2 weeks.
- Paint walls and ceilings with lighter colours as these reflect more light.
- A plumbed, well insulated hot water boiler is more energy efficient than using a jug or kettle.
