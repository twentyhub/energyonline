# Rates
## Can I sign up on the Low User plan for my business?
The Low User Price Plan is only available for your place of primary residence, so commercial properties are ineligible.

## Why has my last invoice got two different charges on it?
If Energy Online changed your prices during your billing period, you will have an invoice with pro-rata charging. This is where we have charged the old rates up to the date of the change and the new rates after the change.
