## Why is last month's payment missing off my account?
We recommend that you check that your payment has cleared through your bank account first. If payment has cleared, please contact us with the following information so we can look into this matter for you â€“ your Energy Online **customer number**, the method you used to make your payment and the date payment was cleared through your bank account.

If the date you made your payment is after the date your invoice was printed then your payment will appear on your next account.

If you have more than one Energy Online account, it may be that the reference with your bank needs to be changed. We can transfer the amount to the correct account and make sure you are awarded with any Prompt Payment Discount applicable.
