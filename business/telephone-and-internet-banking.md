If you wish to pay your account by telephone or internet banking you will need to set this up with your bank. Please select Energy Online under your pre-approved payee:

| Energy Online Bank Account Number:|    03 0584 0225333 00 
| Energy Online Bank:|   Westpac Bank 
 
 
The details that we require to be shown on our bank statement are:
- The name on your Energy Online account
- Your customer number (as it appears on the top right of your Energy Online invoice)
 
Once your bank has set up this payment method for you, you can vary your payment amounts and the frequency of payments to suit your budget, however, please remember that we will need to receive the full amount by the due date for you to get your prompt payment discount.
