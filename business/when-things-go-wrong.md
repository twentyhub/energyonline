# When things go wrong
<p class="intro">From time to time we may get something wrong; we'd like to talk to you about any concerns you might have, so please [contact us](help@energyonline.co.nz) so we can investigate a solution together.
 
At Energy Online it is our aim to resolve any complaints or problems that may arise between you, our customer, and us or our suppliers as quickly and effectively as possible. Details of our disputes resolution process below explain how we will deal with your concerns.</p>
 
**How we’ll handle your complaint**
 
At Energy Online we will do our best to resolve any complaint that arises between you, and us or our suppliers as smoothly and as quickly as possible. Our free internal complaints resolution service is explained as follows;
 
**Our resolution process**
- We will acknowledge receipt of your complaint by writing to you within 2 working days of receiving your complaint. We will also make contact by phone where possible.
- We will send you a progress report within 7 working days if we haven’t already resolved your complaint.
- We will endeavour to resolve your complaint within 20 working days. If we can’t, we will write to you explaining why we need more time to reach a resolution.
- If your complaint is more appropriately dealt with by another party such as a network company or meter company, we may refer your complaint to that company on your behalf. We will notify you that we have referred your complaint on and provide you with the appropriate name and contact details.
 
 
**The next option**
 
We will do our best to resolve any issues directly with you.
 
However you may take your complaint to the office of the Electricity and Gas Complaints Commissioner (EGCC) as a deadlocked complaint if ;
 
- we have not resolved your complaint within 20 working days and have not written to you explaining why we need more time to reach a resolution; or
- we have taken longer than 40 working days to resolve your complaint; or
- you are not happy with our proposed resolution. 
 
The EGCC provides a free and independent complaint handling service for electricity and gas complaints. Your complaint may also be deadlocked;
 
- if during our resolution process the Electricity and Gas Complaints Commissioner is satisfied that you would suffer unreasonable harm waiting any longer; or
- if it would otherwise be unjust to wait any longer.
