## Blling to actual reads
If your business is flexible with due dates, you now have the choice of being invoiced up to your actual meter reads. If your meter can be accessed by our meter readers each month, this means no more estimation! Please contact our [Customer Care Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66) if you'd like to take up this option.

## Business due dates
Otherwise, if your business prefers certainty around the due date, you can choose to have your Energy Online invoice due on either the 18th or 22nd of each month. [Contact us](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66)to take up this option.

## My Account
You can log onto [My Account](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=204), our online service designed to make managing your account easier. You can select to receive invoices by email, view your account history and enter meter reads.

## Fixed term contracts
We know how important it is for you to budget your costs, so we offer contracts to avoid fluctuating energy prices.

During the fixed term contract, Energy Onlineâ€™s component of your charges is fixed. The network component may change during the term of the agreement, and we will pass these changes on to you at cost.

This means that if you are on a fixed term contract, you will receive relative price stability compared to customers not on a contract. If you would like to find out more, please feel free to email us at <mailto:business@energyonline.co.nz> or contact our [Sales Team](http://www.energyonline.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=66).
